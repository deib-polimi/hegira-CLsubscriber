Hegira 4Clouds is able to provide data migration and synchronization when a cloud application is running, thus avoiding any application downtime due to the migration process.

Hegira 4Clouds guarantees that the source and target databases will be eventually consistent at the end of the migration task, and that data will be kept synchronized at any point in time.
